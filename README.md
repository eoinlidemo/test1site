# Adout this project

**Test1site** is the very first project by Eoin Li. It's a *very easy* web project that contains only a few HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. The project is only designated for practice purpose. If you wanted to pay a visit to the website, you can just click the [link](https://eoinlidemo.github.io/test1site/) or download the whole repo to check out the code and static files.

## Note

It's unfortunate that I designed the UI just for 1920x1080 displays, thus the page **may not look good on mobile devices or clearer screens**.
